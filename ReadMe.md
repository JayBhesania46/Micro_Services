# Microservices in JavaScript

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the practical work I've done in creating microservices using JavaScript. In this repository, you'll find a series of hands-on labs that demonstrate different aspects of building microservices with JavaScript, covering topics from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like asynchronous programming, API development, and authentication.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Practice JS Syntax
In this lab, I've practiced JavaScript syntax to build a solid foundation for the upcoming microservice development. It includes basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

### Lab 2: Practice Node.js
In Lab 2, I've delved into Node.js, a runtime that allows executing JavaScript on the server-side. I've learned about the event-driven, non-blocking architecture of Node.js and how to create basic server applications.

### Lab 3: Asynchronous Programming in JS
Asynchronous programming is a critical aspect of microservices. In this lab, I've explored asynchronous programming in JavaScript using callbacks, Promises, and async/await. This knowledge is essential for handling concurrent operations efficiently.

### Lab 4: MongoDB with JS
Microservices often require persistent data storage. In Lab 4, I've integrated MongoDB, a NoSQL database, with JavaScript to understand data modeling, querying, and manipulation within a microservice context.

### Lab 5: JSON Routes with JS
In this lab, I've created routes and endpoints using JavaScript to expose APIs that communicate using JSON. This is a fundamental skill for building microservices that interact with other services or clients.

### Lab 6: API Development with JS
Lab 6 focuses on building APIs using JavaScript. I've learned about RESTful principles, HTTP methods, request handling, and response formatting, all of which are crucial for microservice communication.

### Lab 7: HTML
While microservices primarily deal with server-side logic, it's important to understand client-side aspects as well. Lab 7 covers basic HTML concepts to provide a holistic view of web development.

### Lab 8: API Application with JS
Building on previous labs, Lab 8 involves creating a more comprehensive API application using JavaScript. This lab demonstrates how to structure a microservice application and implement various endpoints.

### Lab 9: Client-Side Text Analyzer with JS
Microservices often interact with user input. In Lab 9, I've developed a client-side text analyzer using JavaScript, showcasing how to handle user input and process it within a microservice context.

### Lab 10: Authentication and Middleware with JS
Security is crucial for microservices. In the final lab, I've explored authentication mechanisms and middleware usage in JavaScript to ensure secure communication and access control.
